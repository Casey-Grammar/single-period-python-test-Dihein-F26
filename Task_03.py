# Task 03 - Replace a Book Title
# Write a function called replace_book(books, old_book, new_book)
# that takes a list of book titles.
#
# If old_book is in the list, replace ONLY the first occurrence
# with new_book and return the updated list.
#
# If old_book is not in the list, return the original list unchanged.
#
# Example:
# replace_book(["Wonder", "Holes", "Matilda"], "Holes", "Hatchet")
# returns ["Wonder", "Hatchet", "Matilda"]

def replace_book(books, old_book, new_book):
    # Check if the book exists in the list first
    if old_book in books:
        # Find the index of the first occurrence
        index = books.index(old_book)
        # Replace the element at that index
        books[index] = new_book
        
    return books
